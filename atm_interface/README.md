#atm interface
During my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting Java programming project called the ATM Interface.

In this project, I developed an interface that simulated an ATM using Java. The interface included functionalities such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and checking the account balance. I implemented input validation to ensure the security and accuracy of transactions.

The ATM Interface project allowed me to gain practical experience in handling user inputs, implementing transactional operations, and connecting with a user's bank account. I focused on creating a user-friendly experience by incorporating intuitive design and error handling.

Throughout the project, I collaborated with my team and sought guidance from experienced mentors. This collaborative environment helped me learn industry best practices and improve my problem-solving skills.

By working on the ATM Interface project, I deepened my understanding of user interface design, data storage, and the importance of error handling. It was a significant project that allowed me to apply my Java programming skills in a real-world context.
I am excited to continue my journey as a Java developer and contribute to innovative projects.
