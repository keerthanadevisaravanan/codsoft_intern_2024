During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on three exciting Java programming projects: a Number Game, a Student Grade Calculator, and an ATM Interface. 

For the Number Game, I developed a Java-based game that prompts the user to guess a random number within a specified range. I implemented features such as limiting the number of attempts, allowing multiple rounds, and displaying the user's score. 

In the Student Grade Calculator project, I created an application to simplify grade calculations. It takes input for marks obtained in each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades. The application also includes data persistence and generates comprehensive reports. 

For the ATM Interface, I developed a Java interface simulating an ATM. It allows users to withdraw, deposit, and check their account balance. Input validation ensures transaction security. 

Throughout these projects, I applied object-oriented programming principles, utilized data structures, and focused on user-friendliness. Collaboration, mentor guidance, and industry best practices ensured high-quality solutions. My GitHub repositories showcase code, documentation, and insights. I am excited to continue my journey as a Java developer and contribute to innovative projects.
