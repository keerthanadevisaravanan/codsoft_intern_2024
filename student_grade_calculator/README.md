#student grade calculator
During my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting Java programming project called the Student Grade Calculator.

The primary goal of this project was to develop an application that simplifies the process of calculating and managing student grades. I implemented various functionalities to achieve this, starting with taking input for marks obtained in each subject. Using these inputs, the application calculated the total marks and average percentage achieved by the student.

To make the grade calculation more comprehensive, I assigned grades to students based on their average percentage. This feature allowed for a more efficient evaluation of student performance. Additionally, I incorporated data persistence, ensuring that the entered data is stored securely within the application.

One of the highlights of this project was the generation of comprehensive reports for both teachers and students. These reports provided a detailed overview of individual student performance, helping teachers and students alike to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement.

By working on the Student Grade Calculator project, I enhanced my Java programming skills and gained practical experience in data management and report generation. I am excited to share this project on GitHub, where you can explore the detailed code, documentation, and insights into the development process.

Thank you for your interest in my internship project. I look forward to continuing my journey as a Java developer and contributing to innovative projects in the future.
