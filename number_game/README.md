#Number Game
During my internship at Codsoft, I had the exciting opportunity to work on a Java programming project called the Number Game. 

In this project, I developed a Java-based game that challenged players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game featured various engaging features, including limiting the number of attempts, allowing multiple rounds, and providing a score based on the number of attempts taken. 

By implementing interactive and user-friendly features, the Number Game provided an enjoyable experience for players. It tested their guessing skills and kept them engaged throughout the game. 

Through this project, I honed my Java programming skills, practiced problem-solving, and gained hands-on experience in creating interactive games. Sharing this project on GitHub allows me to showcase my expertise and passion for Java programming.

Feel free to explore the repository for detailed code, documentation, and insights into the development process of the Number Game. I am excited to continue my journey as a Java developer and contribute to innovative projects.
